# TMS320C64x Firmware Tools

## Information

These are a couple of tools for reverse engineering firmware that runs on the TMS320C64x DSP, such as firmware by at least one HSM vendor.

All of these tools were presented at my [Recon Brussels 2017 talk](https://recon.cx/2017/brussels/talks/hackable_security_modules.html).

You can find the presentation at [my website](https://fotisl.com/reverse/utimaco/recon2017/).
